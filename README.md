# Features
## World Map / Quick Map
- Big pins: Items are reachable according to Randomizer logic.
- Small/grayed out pins: Items are not randomized or not reachable.
- Pins will disappear as you clear their locations. If item previews are enabled, it will show the corresponding previewed item.
- Pin settings are displayed at the bottom. See [Pause Menu](#pause-menu) for more info on the toggles.
- ``CTRL-H``: Expand/collapse the hotkey panel
- ``SHIFT``: Pan faster (same as right thumbstick on controller).

    - Hover over any visible pin to display info about the name, room, status, logic requirements, previewed items (if any) and spoiler items (if Spoilers on).
- ``CTRL-W``: Toggle benchwarp from the World Map on/off.
    - Hover over a room with a bench you have been to, and hold the indicated key/controller bind to do the benchwarp. Tap the same bind to switch benches located at the same map room.

## Pause Menu

    - "Transition": See more info below.
    - "Transition 2": Instead of showing all in-logic + visited rooms, only visited rooms appear. Depending on your Randomizer run, this might not change anything (and therefore may not be an option).

    - "All Pins": Shows all pins, but only show map areas for obtained map items
    - "Pins Over Map": Only show pins over where the corresponding map item has been obtained

    - "Group by": Toggle the pools to be grouped by location, or by item (spoiler).

## Transition Mode
- Check out the in-game map key (`CTRL-K`) or the [Map Legend](./MAPLEGEND.md) for what the colors/brightness of each room indicate.
- Hover over a room and press the indicated key/controller bind to find a path.
- If successful, the path route will be displayed. You can try again to change the start/final transition to what you want.
- If the first step in the route is to benchwarp, hold the indicated key/controller bind to do the benchwarp.
- A compass arrow will point to the next transition you need to go to. The shown route gets updated after every transition.
- The Quick Map also shows the list of unchecked/visited/vanilla transitions for the current room.
- `CTRL-B`: Toggle including benchwarp in the pathfinder on/off.

## Customization
- To customize map and UI colors, download the [template file](https://github.com/syyePhenomenol/HollowKnight.MapModS/releases/download/v2.6.0/colors.json) and copy it to the same folder that contains the mod file ``MapModS.dll``. You only need to quit a save and re-enter one to reload the colors.
    - For Steam + Scarab users on Windows, the default folder is `...\Steam\steamapps\common\Hollow Knight\hollow_knight_Data\Managed\Mods\Randomizer Map S`.
    - Colors will be interpreted in standard RGBA format ``[r, g, b, a]``.
    - If you want to keep the default color of something, delete the corresponding line in the file (or change ``[r, g, b, a]`` to ``[]``).
- To customize pins, make a folder called 'Pins' containing your custom PNG files, and copy it to the same folder that contains the mod file 'MapModS.dll'. You only need to quit a save and re-enter one to reload the pins.
    - See the [default pins](./MapModS/Resources/Pins) for reference.
    - You only need to include the files you want to replace the original ones with.

# How To Install
